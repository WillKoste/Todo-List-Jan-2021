# Todo-List-Jan-2021

Simple todo list to display React fundamentals.

This project uses React for the front-end and JSON-Server for a make-shift back-end server. 

## To Get Started
In the project root, `cd ./client`, into the directory where the getting-started npm scripts are found and `npm i`. You can either use `concurrently` as a dependency if you would like to run the project in a singular terminal, or run `npm run server` & `npm run start` in two separate terminals.
